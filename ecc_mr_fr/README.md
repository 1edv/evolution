The jupyter notebooks (the .ipynb files) in this folder can be viewed from within your browser by clicking on them. If the notebooks fail to render on GitHub on the first try because of a <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3555">known</a> issue, simply reloading the page a couple times should fix it and render the notebooks correctly.  <br>

The jupyter notebooks can also be converted to plain text documents using <a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">jupytext</a> if needed.
