The jupyter notebook (the .ipynb file) in this folder can be viewed from within your browser by clicking on it. If the notebook fails to render on GitHub on the first try because of a <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3555">known</a> issue, simply reloading the page a couple times should fix it and render the notebook correctly.  <br>

The jupyter notebook can also be converted to a plain text document using <a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">jupytext</a> if needed.
