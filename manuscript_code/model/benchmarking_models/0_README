This section includes the analysis where we benchmarked the different neural network architectures in terms of predictive power and ECC calculation. We recommend starting with the following iPython notebook files, which contain additional details about the analyses.

Benchmarking the models' predictive power:
1_reviewer_inspection_benchmarking_prediction_performance.ipynb

Benchmarking the ECC calculated from each model:
2_train_benchmarking_models_and_generate_predictions_and_compute_ecc.ipynb

Reproducing Supplementary Fig. 4 (model performance for the different neural network models)

Training, saving and generating predictions for the benchmarking models using the original parameters :
