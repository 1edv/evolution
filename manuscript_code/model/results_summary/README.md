The notebook in this directory (`1_generate_performance_metrics_and_plots.ipynb`) reproduces the prediction performance scatterplots that summarize the performance of various models used in the manuscript. It also contains the saved prediction tables for each model including the benchmarking models. Please use the individual model directories to generate prediction tables from scratch using the saved models and for more details.
